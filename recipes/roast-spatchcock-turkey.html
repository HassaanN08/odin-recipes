    <h2>What Does 'Spatchcock' Mean?</h2>
    <p>To "spatchcock" means to remove a bird's backbone so that it will lay flat while cooking. This method (also known as butterflying) ensures even cooking, juicier meat, and a quicker cooking time. Why? All the turkey parts are exposed to the same amount of heat for the same duration of time, so you don't have to wait around for the thighs to finish cooking while the breast gets dry.</p>
    <p>Once the turkey is spatchcocked, it's a pretty straightforward process. Again, you'll find the full recipe below — but here's a quick preview:<br>Place the turkey on a roasting rack and rub it all over with oil. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Roast in a preheated oven for about 90 minutes, rotating every 30 minutes. Increase the temperature and continue roasting until the skin is crispy and golden.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (10-pound) whole turkey</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a roasting rack on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Place turkey, breast-side down, on a cutting board. Using a pair of sharp heavy-duty kitchen shears, cut along one side of the backbone.</li>
        <li>Repeat on the other side of the backbone. Remove backbone and reserve for making turkey stock for gravy.</li>
        <li>Press firmly down onto both sides of turkey to flatten.</li>
        <li>Flip turkey breast-side up and put on the roasting rack. Tuck wing tips under turkey (behind breast). Pat skin dry and rub olive oil over entire turkey. Season with sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet every 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and continue to roast until skin is crisp and golden, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover loosely with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
